# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: The syntax for an instance variable is @ followed by the variables assigned name. This is (as the name reveals) is an instance of the chosen variable and not a direct call of the variable itself. 

  Researched answer: After digging a little deeper I learned that what follows the instance variable while its being assigned is actually it's scope. Also i discovered that instance variables are not global.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: Blocks in ruby are built in methods that require a do/end

  Researched answer: After researching blocks a little more I discovered that blocks are anonymous pieces of code that can also use curly braces {} instead of do/end



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: This means that the last line of code that you write in a program will automatically be attempted to be returned by Ruby

  Researched answer: To improve on my previous definition, I would add that an implict return is automatically called upon the last executed instruction in a method when an explicit return has not been used. 



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: This is a programming mind set that focuses on the functionality of objects and thus builds around that functionailty 

  Researched answer: The main difference between the two is that functional programming cannot store data in objects and depends upon the creation of functions to do so. This compaired to object-orients programming which can store data in objects



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class stores key words that are tied to objects

  Researched answer: Classes are templates for objects and define their behavior. An object is an instance of a class
